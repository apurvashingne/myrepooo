Install node version manager (nvm) by typing the following at the command line.
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash
Activate nvm by typing the following at the command line.
. ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
Use nvm to install the latest version of Node.js by typing the following at the command line.
nvm install node
Test that node and npm are installed and running correctly by typing the following at the terminal:
node -v
npm -v


4. Start server to run forever
Now, to keep our server running forever (even when we are not SSH logged in to the instance) we will use an npm package called pm2.

1. Install pm2 by running the following command

npm install -g pm2

2. Set up pm2 to start the server automatically on server restart.

pm2 start app.js
pm2 save
pm2 startup


Note that after running the pm2 startup command we get a command starting with “sudo”.

Copy that command from sudo till the end of the next line and paste it in the terminal and press enter.

Now your node server is running and is set to start automatically whenever you restart the EC2 instance.
